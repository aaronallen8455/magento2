When the next step button is clicked from the address form, a post request is sent to '{cart_id}/shipping-information'
This is initiated by 'shipping-save-processor/default.js'

There is also 'new-address.js' which appears to be used to get the shipping rates when the zip code is changed.
it is unclear how this script gets called. Also unclear why only the county, region, and postcode fields are
in the post request.
'new-address'.getRates gets called from 'shipping-rate-service.js'

The 'shipping.html' KO template which houses the shipping step html, the form element has 'data-bind="submit: setShippingInformation"'
When 'validateShippingInformation' gets called, the form data is copied to the `quote.shippingAddress` observable.

The setShippingInformation method in 'shipping.js' first validates the shipping info and calls 'setShippingInformationAction()' which has a promise that calls 'stepNavigator.next()'
Part of this process is that the address is sent to server side via api '/shipping-information'.

$$$$$$$$$$
In our custom field, set the `dataScope` to 'shippingAddress.custom_attributes.field_name' then it will show up in the JSON array that gets sent to `/shipping-information`
This correlates to class="Magento\Checkout\Api\GuestShippingInformationManagementInterface" method="saveAddressInformation"

When the place order button is clicked, the 'payment/default.js::placeOrder' method is called. Which then calls: Magento_Checkout/js/action/place-order
This sends a post request to '/payment-information' (class="Magento\Checkout\Api\GuestPaymentInformationManagementInterface" method="savePaymentInformationAndPlaceOrder")
eventually routes to \Magento\Quote\Model\QuoteManagement::placeOrder

$$$$$$
theory: if custom_attributes set in the checkout form actually carry through to the $quote->getShippingAddress() object, then we could use the 'sales_model_service_quote_submit_before' event to add the field to the order object.

custom attributes apparently does not carry over...
